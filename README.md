# Project Description: Cat Visibility Toggle

This JavaScript project involves a simple UI interaction where a cat image is shown or hidden based on user input. When the "Build On" button is clicked, the cat becomes visible on the screen. Conversely, clicking the "Build Off" button hides the cat. The project uses basic JavaScript to control the visibility of the cat element, making it a fun and interactive way to practice DOM manipulation and event handling.
